TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

🏗️ OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Batch Embedding Generation:
   ```python
   # Before: Individual processing
   for text in texts:
       embedding = model.encode([text])
   
   # After: Batch processing
   embeddings = model.encode(texts, batch_size=32, show_progress_bar=False)
   ```

2. Embedding Caching System:
   ```python
   def _get_embeddings_with_cache(self, texts: List[str]) -> np.ndarray:
       # Check cache first
       cached_embeddings, uncached_texts, uncached_indices = self._get_cached_embeddings(texts)
       
       # Generate only for uncached texts
       if uncached_texts:
           new_embeddings = self.embedding_model.encode(uncached_texts, batch_size=32)
           self._cache_embeddings(uncached_texts, new_embeddings)
   ```

3. Vectorized Similarity Calculation:
   ```python
   # Before: Individual calculations
   for doc_embedding in doc_embeddings:
       similarity = np.dot(query_embedding, doc_embedding) / (
           np.linalg.norm(query_embedding) * np.linalg.norm(doc_embedding)
       )
   
   # After: Vectorized operations
   query_norm = np.linalg.norm(query_embedding)
   doc_norms = np.linalg.norm(doc_embeddings, axis=1)
   similarities = np.dot(doc_embeddings, query_embedding) / (doc_norms * query_norm)
   ```

4. Performance Monitoring:
   ```python
   # Detailed timing for each stage
   logger.info(f"Database query time: {db_time:.3f}s")
   logger.info(f"Query embedding time: {query_embedding_time:.3f}s")
   logger.info(f"Batch embedding generation time: {batch_time:.3f}s")
